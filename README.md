Futura combines **ICP** and **blockchain technologies** to safeguard the most meaningful memories of a person for the long term, ensuring they can be passed down across generations.

## Current Offering

At this stage, users can choose between **Web2** and **Web3 storage** options.  
Our initial go-to-market strategy focuses on **wedding photography**:

1. We facilitate the transfer of ownership from the photographer to the newlyweds.
2. Newlyweds are then offered the option to **store their memories forever**.
3. From there, they can expand to preserving other significant data they wish to pass on to future generations‚Äîsuch as autobiographies, personal documents, and cherished memories.

We‚Äôve recently partnered with a professional photographer [Salih, our Partner](https://www.instagram.com/salih_kurbet_films/) and are eager to gather feedback from clients and measure conversion rates over the coming months.

## Long-Term Vision

While weddings are our starting point, Futura‚Äôs mission goes beyond photography.  
We are building a future of **digital inheritance**, ensuring your legacy endures:

- Your descendants will inherit your **digital archive**‚Äîphotos, texts, documents, and more.
- They will be able to **interact with your data** through an AI-driven project called **Transcendance**, enabling conversations with the digital reflection of your life.

## Features

### üîê **Dual Web2/Web3 Authentication**

Futura implements a dual authentication system leveraging Authjs and the Internet Identity, allowing ICP users to safely use the Internet Identity to signin/signup in the Web2 app.

- **Dual Authentication**: Users can sign in with both traditional OAuth providers (Google) and Web3 identity (Internet Identity)
- **Co-Authentication Flow**: Users can link their Internet Identity to existing Web2 accounts, enabling seamless access to both storage systems
- **Session Synchronization**: NextAuth.js manages unified sessions that work across both authentication methods
- **Principal Verification**: Cryptographic nonce-based verification ensures users control their claimed Internet Identity principals

#### **Authentication Flows**

**Flow 1: Traditional Web2 Sign-in (Google)**

```
User ‚Üí Google OAuth ‚Üí NextAuth.js ‚Üí JWT Session ‚Üí Web2 Storage Access
```

**Flow 2: Internet Identity Standalone Sign-in**

```
User ‚Üí Internet Identity ‚Üí Nonce Challenge ‚Üí Principal Verification ‚Üí NextAuth.js ‚Üí JWT Session ‚Üí Web3 Storage Access
```

**Flow 3: Co-Authentication (Google + Internet Identity)**

```
User ‚Üí Google OAuth ‚Üí NextAuth.js Session ‚Üí Link Internet Identity ‚Üí Co-Authentication Enabled ‚Üí Access to Both Storage Systems
```

#### **Technical Challenges Solved**

**1. Internet Identity Integration in Web2 Apps**

- **Challenge**: Internet Identity is designed for Web3 dApps, not traditional Web2 applications
- **Solution**: Custom NextAuth.js provider that handles II authentication flow
- **Implementation**: Direct canister calls for nonce verification, bypassing traditional OAuth flows

**2. Session Management Across Systems**

- **Challenge**: Web2 sessions (JWT) vs Web3 sessions (ICP agent) are fundamentally different
- **Solution**: Unified session management through NextAuth.js with custom JWT claims
- **Implementation**: Store both Web2 user data and Web3 principal information in single JWT token

**3. Principal Verification Security**

- **Challenge**: Ensuring users actually control their claimed Internet Identity principals
- **Solution**: Cryptographic nonce-based challenge-response verification
- **Implementation**: Server-side nonce generation, client-side signing, canister verification

**4. Cross-Platform Compatibility**

- **Challenge**: Internet Identity works differently across browsers and devices
- **Solution**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- **Implementation**: Multiple authentication paths with graceful degradation

**5. Session Synchronization**

- **Challenge**: Keeping Web2 and Web3 sessions in sync when users switch between them
- **Solution**: Real-time session updates with NextAuth.js `update()` function
- **Implementation**: Automatic session refresh when II authentication state changes

## Technology Approach

Futura leverages **ICP's storage innovations** and the security of decentralized infrastructure:

- [Dom](https://x.com/dominic_w/status/1955447139347337491) (ICP) has announced unprecedented reductions in storage costs, supporting projects like **Caffeine**. We build upon this strategy to make **long-term, highly accessible storage** possible.
- Decentralization ensures the **longevity and security** of hosted files.
- We focus on **data ownership and ownership transfer**, particularly in the delivery of digital files.

## Clone with submodules

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/552020/futura_alpha_icp.git
```

### Local dev quickstart

```bash
dfx start --background
./scripts/deploy-local.sh
# Optional: run Next.js locally
cd src/nextjs && npm run dev
```

## Local Development

To test and develop locally:

0. **Setup environment**:

   ```bash
   # Copy the example file and fill in your values
   cp src/nextjs/.env.local.example src/nextjs/.env.local
   # Edit src/nextjs/.env.local with your actual credentials
   ```

1. **Start DFX** (Internet Computer local replica):

   ```bash
   dfx start --clean --background
   ```

2. **Deploy canisters**:

   ```bash
   # Install required tools for the deploy script
   cargo install generate-did
   cargo install ic-cdk-optimizer --locked
   cargo install candid-extractor --locked

   chmod +x scripts/deploy-local.sh  # Only needed first time
   ./scripts/deploy-local.sh
   ```

3. **Start Next.js development server**:
   ```bash
   cd src/nextjs
   npm run dev
   ```
