# Backend HTTP URL Generation Architecture Question

## Question for Tech Lead

**Should the backend generate HTTP URLs with localhost for local development, or should the frontend handle environment-specific URL construction?**

## Current Implementation Approach

I'm implementing the ICP asset URL generation system where the backend generates HTTP URLs with tokens during memory listing. However, I'm questioning whether the backend should be responsible for generating environment-specific URLs.

### Current Backend Implementation

```rust
// src/backend/src/http/mod.rs
pub fn get_http_base_url() -> String {
    if cfg!(feature = "local") {
        "http://localhost:4943".to_string()
    } else {
        let canister_id = std::env::var("CANISTER_ID_BACKEND")
            .unwrap_or_else(|_| "uxrrr-q7777-77774-qaaaq-cai".to_string());
        format!("https://{}.ic0.app", canister_id)
    }
}

// Used in memory listing:
let http_url = format!("{}/asset/{}/thumbnail?token={}",
    get_http_base_url(), memory_id, token);
```

## Alternative Approaches

### Option A: Backend Generates Full URLs (Current)

- **Pros**: Frontend gets ready-to-use URLs, no environment logic needed
- **Cons**: Backend needs to know about frontend environments, couples backend to deployment

### Option B: Backend Generates Relative URLs + Frontend Adds Base

- **Pros**: Backend stays environment-agnostic, frontend controls base URLs
- **Cons**: Frontend needs to detect environment and construct full URLs

```rust
// Backend returns: "/asset/abc123/thumbnail?token=xyz"
// Frontend constructs: `${baseUrl}/asset/abc123/thumbnail?token=xyz`
```

### Option C: Backend Returns Token + Frontend Constructs Everything

- **Pros**: Maximum separation of concerns
- **Cons**: More complex frontend logic

## Questions for Tech Lead

1. **Should the backend be responsible for generating environment-specific URLs?**
2. **Is it better to have the backend return relative URLs and let the frontend handle base URL construction?**
3. **What's the preferred pattern for environment-specific configuration in our architecture?**

## Context

This is part of the ICP asset serving system where:

- Backend generates HTTP URLs with tokens during memory listing
- Frontend uses these URLs directly with Next.js Image components
- We need to support both local development and production environments

## Impact

This decision affects:

- Where environment configuration lives
- How tightly coupled backend and frontend are
- Ease of deployment and environment management
