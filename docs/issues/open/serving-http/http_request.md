Certainly! Here is a minimal, working implementation of a `http_request` method for a canister, based on the official specification. This example is in Rust, and it matches the required interface for the HTTP Gateway to interact with your canister:

```rust
#[ic_cdk::query]
fn http_request(_req: HttpRequest) -> HttpResponse {
    HttpResponse {
        status_code: 200,
        headers: vec![],
        body: b"Hello, world!".to_vec(),
    }
}
```

Where the types are defined as:

```rust
pub type HeaderField = (String, String);

pub struct HttpRequest {
    pub method: String,
    pub url: String,
    pub headers: Vec<HeaderField>,
    pub body: Vec<u8>,
}

pub struct HttpResponse {
    pub status_code: u16,
    pub headers: Vec<HeaderField>,
    pub body: Vec<u8>,
}
```

This implementation simply returns a 200 OK response with "Hello, world!" as the body. It matches the minimum required interface for the HTTP Gateway ProtocolÂ [Minimum Canister Interface](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/references/http-gateway-protocol-spec#minimum-canister-interface).

If you need a Motoko example, here is the equivalent:

```motoko
actor {
  public query func http_request(_req: HttpRequest) : async HttpResponse {
    {
      status_code = 200;
      headers = [];
      body = "Hello, world!";
    }
  }
}
```

This is the smallest working implementation according to the knowledge sources.
