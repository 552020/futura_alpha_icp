# Frontend ICP Upload Implementation

## 📋 **Issue Summary**

✅ **COMPLETE** - Frontend-to-ICP backend upload functionality has been implemented and enhanced with valuable features from the redundant implementation. **All testing completed** and functionality confirmed.

## 🎯 **Current State**

- ✅ **Backend**: ICP upload API with chunked uploads and blob_read endpoint
- ✅ **Node.js Uploader**: Working uploader with mainnet authentication
- ✅ **Settings**: Users can select ICP as blob hosting preference
- ✅ **Frontend**: Complete ICP upload implementation in `upload/icp-upload.ts`
- ✅ **Migration**: Enhanced with features from redundant class-based implementation
- ✅ **Testing**: All testing completed and functionality confirmed

## 🔄 **Upload Flow**

```
Hosting Preferences (ICP selected) → Upload Button (File/Folder) → Routing Logic → Authentication Check → Upload Original + Asset Creation → Upload Derivative Assets
```

### **Detailed Flow:**

1. **Hosting Preferences** (ICP selected by default for II users)

   - Users who register through Internet Identity should have ICP as default for Blob/Backend/DB
   - Users can change preferences in settings page or through other UI components
   - **Note**: Users can have preferences without touching the settings page (e.g., through onboarding)
   - **Relevant files:**
     - `src/nextjs/src/app/[lang]/user/settings/page.tsx` - Settings UI
     - `src/nextjs/src/hooks/use-hosting-preferences.ts` - Hosting preferences hook
     - `src/nextjs/src/app/api/me/hosting-preferences/route.ts` - Hosting preferences API
     - `src/nextjs/auth.ts` - Authentication configuration
     - `src/nextjs/src/app/[lang]/user/icp/page.tsx` - ICP main page (reference for ICP patterns)
     - `src/nextjs/src/components/auth/user-button-client-with-ii.tsx` - II authentication components

2. **Upload Button** (File/Folder Upload)

   - User selects files or folders to upload
   - Triggers upload process

3. **Routing Logic** (single-file-processor.ts / multiple-file-processor.ts)

   - Determines upload destination based on user preferences
   - Routes to appropriate upload service (ICP, S3, Vercel Blob, etc.)

4. **Authentication Check** (Before Upload)

   - Check if user is authenticated with Internet Identity
   - Users authenticated with Google still need II for ICP uploads
   - Verify Actor and Agent creation for ICP communication

5. **Upload Original + Asset Creation**

   - Upload original file to ICP blob storage
   - Create asset records in database
   - Generate derivative assets (thumbnails, etc.)

6. **Upload Derivative Assets**
   - Upload generated thumbnails and other derivatives
   - Complete the upload process

## 📁 **Key Files**

### **Authentication & Settings:**

- `src/nextjs/auth.ts` - Authentication configuration
- `src/nextjs/src/app/[lang]/user/settings/page.tsx` - Hosting preferences UI
- `src/nextjs/src/hooks/use-hosting-preferences.ts` - Hosting preferences hook
- `src/nextjs/src/app/api/me/hosting-preferences/route.ts` - Hosting preferences API
- `src/nextjs/src/app/[lang]/user/icp/page.tsx` - ICP main page (reference for ICP patterns)
- `src/nextjs/src/components/auth/user-button-client-with-ii.tsx` - II authentication components

### **Upload Processing:**

- `src/nextjs/src/services/upload/single-file-processor.ts` - Upload routing logic
- `src/nextjs/src/services/upload/multiple-file-processor.ts` - Multiple file routing logic
- `src/nextjs/src/services/upload/icp-upload.ts` - ✅ **Complete ICP upload implementation**

### **Reference Implementation:**

- `tests/backend/shared-capsule/upload/ic-upload.mjs` - Working Node.js uploader

## 🔀 **Routing Logic**

### **Upload Destination Decision:**

The routing logic determines where to upload files based on user preferences:

```typescript
// In single-file-processor.ts / multiple-file-processor.ts
if (preferences.blob_storage === "icp") {
  // Route to ICP upload service
  const { uploadToICP } = await import("./icp-upload");
  results = await uploadToICP(files, preferences, onProgress);
} else if (preferences.blob_storage === "s3") {
  // Route to S3 upload service
  const { uploadToS3 } = await import("./s3-upload");
  results = await uploadToS3(files, preferences, onProgress);
} else if (preferences.blob_storage === "vercel_blob") {
  // Route to Vercel Blob upload service
  const { uploadToVercelBlob } = await import("./vercel-blob-upload");
  results = await uploadToVercelBlob(files, preferences, onProgress);
}
```

### **Upload Architecture Options:**

**Note**: Upload to ICP Blob (which is in the same canister as the backend) could happen:

- **Frontend side** (current approach) - Direct upload from browser to ICP
- **Backend side** (Vercel) - Upload to Vercel first, then to ICP

**Current Implementation**: We are going with the **frontend side** approach for direct ICP uploads.

### **Current Scope - Blob Storage Only:**

**Note**: At the moment we will add only the **Blob functionality**. This means we aim first to solve the problem of having files saved also in ICP, and we want to keep track of the metadata so we want to have also a copy of the Memory DB.

**Backend Architecture Note**: The organization of the backend is in **capsules** - we don't have a central Memory table, but each capsule representing a user has its own memory struct.
