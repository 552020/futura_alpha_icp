# Upload Session Changelog

All notable changes to the upload session system.

---

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-01 - ✅ COMPLETE

### 🎉 Achievement: 100% Test Success (5/5)

Complete rewrite of upload session management with generic architecture.

### Added

#### Core Features
- **Generic SessionService** for reusable session lifecycle management
- **SessionCompat** compatibility layer for gradual migration
- **ByteSink trait** for abstract chunk writing
- **StableBlobSink** implementation for direct stable memory writes
- **Rolling hash verification** (incremental SHA256 during upload)

#### Reliability
- **Deterministic SHA256 keys** replacing non-deterministic DefaultHasher
- **Session-aware keys** for parallel upload safety
- **Idempotency handling** for duplicate requests
- **Atomic finish operations** with hash verification

#### Monitoring
- Structured logging in `uploads_finish` (FINISH_START, FINISH_HASH_OK, etc.)
- Blob write/read tracing (BLOB_WRITE, BLOB_READ)
- Debug canary endpoints for stable memory testing

### Changed

#### Key Type Migration
- **STABLE_BLOB_STORE** key type: `(u64, u32)` → `([u8; 32], u32)`
  - Old: `(blob_id, chunk_idx)` with non-deterministic blob_id
  - New: `(pmid_session_hash32, chunk_idx)` with SHA256 derivation

#### Hash Verification
- Removed read-back hash verification from `BlobStore::store_from_chunks`
- Added rolling hash in `uploads_put_chunk` (incremental update)
- Verify hash in `uploads_finish` before commit

#### bytes_expected Calculation
- Before: `chunk_count * chunk_size` (incorrect for last chunk)
- After: `asset_metadata.get_base().bytes` (correct source of truth)

#### Session Structure
- Added `session_id: u64` to `UploadSessionMeta`
- Added `pmid_hash: [u8; 32]` to `BlobMeta`
- Updated `StableBlobSink` to store `pmid_hash` instead of `provisional_memory_id`

### Fixed

#### Critical Bugs
1. **Non-deterministic keys** (DefaultHasher)
   - Impact: Chunks written but not found on read (complete data loss)
   - Fix: Use SHA256 for deterministic, reproducible keys
   - Result: 0% → 40% test success

2. **Parallel upload collisions**
   - Impact: Parallel uploads with same `provisional_memory_id` collided
   - Fix: Include `session_id` in key derivation (`pmid_session_hash32`)
   - Result: 80% → 100% test success

3. **Incorrect bytes_expected**
   - Impact: Last chunk validation failed
   - Fix: Use `asset_metadata.get_base().bytes` instead of formula
   - Result: Correct upload size validation

4. **Hash verification performance**
   - Impact: Slow read-back after upload
   - Fix: Rolling hash during upload (no read-back needed)
   - Result: Faster, more reliable verification

5. **Stable memory corruption after key type change**
   - Impact: New data not readable after `STABLE_BLOB_STORE` key type change
   - Fix: `dfx canister uninstall-code backend` to clear corrupted memory
   - Result: Fresh stable memory, data persistence works

### Performance

- Single 21MB upload: **33.4s (0.62 MB/s)**
- Parallel 4-file upload: **42s (0.50 MB/s)**
- Parallel efficiency: **79%**

### Technical Debt

- ⚠️ SessionCompat is a temporary compatibility layer
- ⚠️ Debug logging should be removed in production
- ⚠️ Canary endpoints should be removed in production
- See **REFACTORING_TODO.md** for planned cleanup

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-30 - Initial Implementation

### Added

- Basic upload session management
- Chunk-based upload system
- Stable memory storage (STABLE_BLOB_STORE, STABLE_BLOB_META)
- Session expiration (TTL)

### Known Issues

- ❌ DefaultHasher used for blob_id (non-deterministic)
- ❌ No parallel upload safety
- ❌ Read-back hash verification (slow)
- ❌ bytes_expected calculated incorrectly
- ❌ All E2E tests failing (0/5)

## Migration Notes

### From 1.x to 2.0

#### Breaking Changes

1. **STABLE_BLOB_STORE key type changed**
   - Requires clearing stable memory in local dev
   - Production deployment needs migration strategy

2. **BlobMeta structure changed**
   - Added `pmid_hash: [u8; 32]` field
   - Existing blobs need migration

3. **Session metadata changed**
   - Added `session_id` to UploadSessionMeta
   - Affects serialization

#### Migration Steps (Local Dev)

```bash
# 1. Clear stable memory
dfx canister uninstall-code backend

# 2. Redeploy
dfx deploy backend

# 3. Run tests
cd tests/backend/shared-capsule/upload/session
node test_session_persistence.mjs
```

#### Migration Steps (Production)

TODO: Implement versioned memory regions or data migration
- Use separate memory IDs for old/new blob stores
- Migrate data in background
- Switch over when complete

## Dependencies

### New Dependencies (2.0.0)

```toml
[dependencies]
sha2 = "0.10"        # For deterministic SHA256 hashing
hex = "0.4"          # For hash logging
```

### Existing Dependencies

```toml
ic-cdk = "0.12"
ic-stable-structures = "0.6"
candid = "0.10"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
```

---

## Testing Results

### Unit Tests
- ⚠️ Some tests use `ic_cdk::api::time()` (only work in canister)
- ✅ Generic SessionService tests pass with mock Clock

### E2E Tests (All Passing)

| Test | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| test_session_persistence.mjs | Single 21MB upload | ✅ PASS |
| test_session_isolation.mjs | Parallel 2-lane upload | ✅ PASS |
| test_asset_retrieval_debug.mjs | Image processing + derivatives | ✅ PASS |
| test_session_collision.mjs | Concurrent session safety | ✅ PASS |
| test_session_debug.mjs | Session lifecycle | ✅ PASS |

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Deterministic Keys Are Critical

**Problem**: DefaultHasher produced different keys for same input  
**Impact**: Complete data loss (chunks written but not found)  
**Solution**: SHA256 for cryptographically sound, deterministic keys

### 2. Rolling Hash > Read-Back

**Problem**: Read-back verification was slow and unreliable  
**Impact**: Performance issues, stale data problems  
**Solution**: Incremental hash during upload

### 3. Session ID in Keys for Parallel Safety

**Problem**: Parallel uploads collided on same `provisional_memory_id`  
**Impact**: Last write wins, data corruption  
**Solution**: Include `session_id` in key derivation

### 4. Stable Memory Type Changes Break Things

**Problem**: Changing `StableBTreeMap<K, V>` types corrupts memory  
**Impact**: Data unreadable after type change  
**Solution**: Clear memory in dev, implement migration for production

### 5. Generic Architecture Pays Off

**Problem**: Upload-specific session logic was tangled  
**Impact**: Hard to test, hard to extend  
**Solution**: Separate generic SessionService + upload-specific compat layer
