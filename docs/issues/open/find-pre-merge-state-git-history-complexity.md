# Finding Pre-Merge State: Git History Complexity Issue

## **Problem Statement**

We need to identify the **true pre-merge state** of branch `552020/icp-421-fix-small-stuff-while-reading-the-upload-flow` before we merged `main` into it, but the Git history is more complex than expected.

## **Current Situation**

### **What We Did:**

1. **Started with** `552020/icp-421-fix-small-stuff-while-reading-the-upload-flow` (had gallery work)
2. **Merged main** into it → created merge commit `f6cb04a`
3. **Resolved 15 conflicts** and committed the merge
4. **Want to go back** to the pre-merge state for manual file-by-file merging

### **The Problem:**

When we merged `main`, Git didn't just add a merge commit - it **integrated the entire commit history** from main into our branch. This means:

- **Our branch now contains commits from both branches**
- **Simple "go back one commit" doesn't work** because the history is mixed
- **We can't easily identify** what was the true pre-merge state

## **Git History Analysis**

### **Current Branch State:**

```
f3ee46a chore: fix formatting and linting issues after merge
f6cb04a Merge main into feature branch  ← THE MERGE COMMIT
83a0a9c Merge pull request #46 from 552020/lmangallon/icp-450-implement-select-button-for-gallery
aa8105a refactor (grid & card): create higher reliance on base components
```

### **The Issue:**

- `83a0a9c` is **also a merge commit** ("Merge pull request #46")
- `aa8105a` is **also in main** (not unique to our branch)
- **We can't find the true pre-merge state** by going back commits

### **Commits Unique to Our Branch:**

```bash
git log --oneline main..552020/icp-421-fix-small-stuff-while-reading-the-upload-flow
```

Shows many commits, but we need to identify which one was the **last commit before the main merge**.

## **The Challenge**

### **What We Need:**

The exact commit that represents the state of `552020/icp-421-fix-small-stuff-while-reading-the-upload-flow` **before** we merged main into it.

### **What We Have:**

- Mixed commit history with commits from both branches
- Multiple merge commits
- No clear "pre-merge" marker

### **The Problem:**

1. **Git merge strategy** integrated both histories
2. **No clear boundary** between "our work" and "main's work"
3. **Multiple merge commits** make it hard to identify the true pre-merge state

## **Possible Solutions**

### **Option 1: Find the Last Unique Commit**

```bash
# Find commits that are ONLY in our branch (not in main)
git log --oneline main..552020/icp-421-fix-small-stuff-while-reading-the-upload-flow
# Then identify the last one before the merge
```

### **Option 2: Use Git Reflog**

```bash
# Check reflog to see the exact state before merge
git reflog show 552020/icp-421-fix-small-stuff-while-reading-the-upload-flow
```

### **Option 3: Recreate the Branch**

```bash
# Start fresh from a known good state
# Create new branch from a commit we know is pre-merge
```

### **Option 4: Use Git Bisect**

```bash
# Use bisect to find the exact commit where main was merged
git bisect start
git bisect bad HEAD  # Current state (has main merged)
git bisect good <known-pre-merge-commit>
```

## **Questions for Senior**

1. **How do we identify the true pre-merge state** when Git has integrated both histories?

2. **What's the best strategy** to find the exact commit before the main merge?

3. **Should we use reflog** to see the exact state before the merge operation?

4. **Is there a Git command** that shows the state of a branch before a specific merge?

5. **Should we recreate the branch** from a known good state instead of trying to find the pre-merge state?

## **Expected Outcome**

We want to:

- ✅ **Identify the exact pre-merge commit**
- ✅ **Create a clean branch** from that state
- ✅ **Manually merge main** file by file with full control
- ✅ **Preserve both gallery implementations** (old and new)

## **Technical Details**

### **Branch History:**

- **Original branch**: Had gallery work with Store Forever functionality
- **Main branch**: Had new gallery components and selection mode
- **After merge**: Mixed history with commits from both branches

### **The Merge:**

- **Merge commit**: `f6cb04a`
- **Strategy**: Git integrated both histories
- **Result**: Complex commit history with no clear pre-merge boundary

## **Next Steps**

1. **Get senior guidance** on finding the pre-merge state
2. **Implement the recommended solution**
3. **Create clean pre-merge branch**
4. **Start manual merge process**
