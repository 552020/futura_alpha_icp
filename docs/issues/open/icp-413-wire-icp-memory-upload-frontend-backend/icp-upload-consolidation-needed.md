# ICP Upload Consolidation Needed

## Problem

We have two different ICP upload implementations with massive code duplication and different purposes, causing maintenance issues and developer confusion.

## Current State

### Two Functions Exist:

1. **`uploadFileToICP`** (icp-upload.ts) - Basic implementation with extensive debugging
2. **`uploadToICPWithProcessing`** (icp-with-processing.ts) - Advanced implementation with parallel processing

### Issues:

- **Massive Code Duplication** across multiple files
- **Different Architectures** - monolithic vs modular
- **Inconsistent Behavior** - different error handling and logging
- **Developer Confusion** - unclear which function to use
- **Maintenance Burden** - changes need to be made in multiple places

## Impact

- **Development**: Logging broken, debugging difficult
- **Maintenance**: Two different patterns to maintain
- **Code Quality**: Violates DRY principle
- **Performance**: Duplicate code increases bundle size

## Solution Required

Consolidate into a single, unified ICP upload function that combines:

- **Advanced architecture** from `uploadToICPWithProcessing`
- **Debugging capabilities** from `uploadFileToICP`
- **Consistent error handling** and logging
- **Single source of truth** for ICP uploads

## Priority

**High** - This is blocking development and creating maintenance issues.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Single ICP upload function
- [ ] No code duplication
- [ ] Consistent logging and debugging
- [ ] Unified error handling
- [ ] Clear documentation
- [ ] All tests passing
