# Implement Delete Account Functionality

## 🎯 **Feature Request**

Add the ability for users to permanently delete their account and all associated data from the platform.

## 🎨 **UX/UI Design Decision**

### **Recommended Location: Settings Page**

**Why Settings over Profile:**

- ✅ **Intentional action** - Users go to settings to manage their account
- ✅ **Safety context** - Settings feel like "account management" area
- ✅ **Confirmation flow** - Natural place for warnings and confirmations
- ✅ **Grouped with other account actions** - Password change, data export, etc.
- ❌ **Profile page** - Too personal, higher risk of accidental deletion

### **Proposed Settings Structure:**

```
Settings
├── Profile Settings
│   ├── Change Name
│   ├── Change Email
│   └── Change Password
├── Account Management
│   ├── Export Data
│   ├── Download Memories
│   └── 🚨 Delete Account (with warning)
└── Privacy & Security
    ├── Data Sharing
    └── Account Visibility
```

## 🔒 **Security & Safety Requirements**

### **Multi-Step Confirmation Flow:**

1. **Initial Warning** - "This action cannot be undone"
2. **Data Summary** - Show what will be deleted (memories, galleries, etc.)
3. **Confirmation Input** - User must type "DELETE" to confirm
4. **Final Confirmation** - "Are you absolutely sure?" with checkbox
5. **Grace Period** - Optional 7-day delay before actual deletion

### **Data Deletion Scope:**

- ✅ **User account** - All personal information
- ✅ **Memories** - All uploaded files and metadata
- ✅ **Galleries** - All created galleries
- ✅ **Relationships** - All business relationships
- ✅ **Sessions** - All active sessions
- ✅ **Analytics data** - User tracking data

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **Backend Requirements:**

1. **Delete Account API** - `DELETE /api/user/account`
2. **Data cascade deletion** - Remove all related records
3. **File cleanup** - Delete all uploaded files from storage
4. **Audit logging** - Log account deletions for compliance
5. **Grace period** - Optional delayed deletion

### **Frontend Requirements:**

1. **Settings page integration** - Add delete account section
2. **Confirmation modal** - Multi-step warning flow
3. **Loading states** - Show deletion progress
4. **Success/error handling** - Proper user feedback

### **Database Schema Considerations:**

```sql
-- Add soft delete to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN deleted_at TIMESTAMP;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN deletion_requested_at TIMESTAMP;

-- Add cascade deletion for related tables
-- Ensure all foreign keys have ON DELETE CASCADE
```

## 🧪 **Testing Requirements**

### **E2E Test Scenarios:**

1. **Happy path** - User successfully deletes account
2. **Confirmation flow** - All warning steps work correctly
3. **Data verification** - All user data is actually deleted
4. **Error handling** - Network failures, server errors
5. **Grace period** - If implemented, test delayed deletion

### **Security Tests:**

1. **Authorization** - Only account owner can delete
2. **CSRF protection** - Prevent unauthorized deletions
3. **Rate limiting** - Prevent abuse of delete endpoint
4. **Data integrity** - Ensure complete data removal

## 📋 **Implementation Checklist**

### **Phase 1: Backend**

- [ ] Create delete account API endpoint
- [ ] Implement data cascade deletion
- [ ] Add file cleanup for uploaded content
- [ ] Add audit logging
- [ ] Test data integrity after deletion

### **Phase 2: Frontend**

- [ ] Add delete account section to settings
- [ ] Create confirmation modal component
- [ ] Implement multi-step warning flow
- [ ] Add loading states and error handling
- [ ] Test user experience flow

### **Phase 3: Testing**

- [ ] Write E2E tests for delete flow
- [ ] Test data deletion verification
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Security testing
- [ ] Performance testing for large accounts

## 🚨 **Security Considerations**

### **Prevent Accidental Deletion:**

- **Multiple confirmations** - Require explicit user intent
- **Typing confirmation** - User must type "DELETE"
- **Grace period** - Optional 7-day delay before actual deletion
- **Email notification** - Notify user of deletion request

### **Prevent Unauthorized Deletion:**

- **Authentication required** - Must be logged in
- **Authorization check** - Only account owner can delete
- **CSRF protection** - Prevent cross-site request forgery
- **Rate limiting** - Prevent abuse of delete endpoint

## 📊 **Success Metrics**

- **User adoption** - How many users use the feature
- **Completion rate** - How many users complete the deletion
- **Abandonment rate** - Where users drop off in the flow
- **Support tickets** - Reduced requests for account deletion
- **Data compliance** - Successful data removal verification

## 🔄 **Alternative Approaches**

### **Soft Delete (Recommended):**

- Mark account as deleted but keep data for 30 days
- Allow account recovery within grace period
- Better for accidental deletions
- Easier to implement

### **Hard Delete:**

- Immediate permanent deletion
- No recovery possible
- Higher risk of data loss
- More complex implementation

## 📝 **Notes**

- **GDPR Compliance** - Ensure deletion meets privacy requirements
- **Data Backup** - Consider backup strategy before deletion
- **User Communication** - Clear messaging about what gets deleted
- **Support Process** - Handle edge cases and user questions

## 🎯 **Priority**

**High** - Essential feature for user control and privacy compliance.

## 📅 **Estimated Timeline**

- **Backend Implementation:** 3-5 days
- **Frontend Implementation:** 2-3 days
- **Testing & QA:** 2-3 days
- **Total:** 1-2 weeks
