## ‚úÖ **COMPLETED ISSUES (10 - Moved to `done/` directory)**

The following 10 issues have been completed and moved to the `done/` directory:

1. **stable-memory-8192-byte-limit-architectural-constraint.md** - Critical P0 issue resolved
2. **memory-create-implementation.md** - Critical P0 issue resolved
3. **update-with-method-implementation.md** - P1 issue resolved
4. **phase-0-regrouping-todo.md** - P1 issue resolved
5. **memory-endpoint-reorganization.md** - P1 issue resolved
6. **capsule-crud-operations-implementation.md** - P1 issue resolved
7. **capsule-module-refactoring.md** - P2 issue resolved
8. **legacy-partitions-usage-analysis.md** - P2 issue resolved
9. **memory-api-unification-todo.md** - P1 issue resolved
10. **upload-workflow-implementation-plan.md** - P2 issue resolved (superseded by v2)

These issues represented critical blocking problems and major organizational improvements that have been successfully resolved, restoring system functionality and improving code organization. The capsule CRUD operations implementation completed the essential CRUD system with comprehensive test coverage. The capsule module refactoring achieved optimal code organization, and the legacy partitions cleanup eliminated technical debt. The memory API unification successfully organized all memory endpoints under a single, well-structured section with clear subheaders. The original upload workflow implementation plan was superseded by the improved v2 version.
