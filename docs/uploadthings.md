- **Used as SDK only**: Use just the client/server packages without their managed service

This makes it particularly interesting for projects like ours that need:

- Full control over the infrastructure
- Custom storage backends (like ICP)
- Specific authentication flows
- Custom file processing pipelines
- **Long-term stability** and community support

### Key Features

#### 1. Type-Safe File Router

```typescript
export const uploadRouter = {
  videoAndImage: f({
    image: {
      maxFileSize: "32MB",
      maxFileCount: 4,
      acl: "public-read",
    },
    video: {
      maxFileSize: "16MB",
    },
    blob: {
      maxFileSize: "8GB",
    },
  })
    .middleware(({ req, files }) => {
      // Authentication/authorization logic
      return { userId: "user123" };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(({ file, metadata }) => {
      // Post-upload processing
      console.log("Upload completed", file);
    }),
};
```

#### 2. React Integration

```typescript
// Generated helpers with full type safety
export const { useUploadThing } = generateReactHelpers<OurFileRouter>();

// Usage in components
const { startUpload, isUploading } = useUploadThing("videoAndImage", {
  onUploadProgress: (progress) => console.log(progress),
  onClientUploadComplete: (res) => console.log("Done!", res),
});
```

#### 3. Pre-built Components

- `UploadButton` - Click-to-upload button
- `UploadDropzone` - Drag-and-drop zone
- `UploadFileView` - File preview/management
- `UploadProvider` - Context provider for upload state

#### 4. Advanced Features

- **Pause/Resume**: Uploads can be paused and resumed

- **File Validation**: Client and server-side validation
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error system with custom formatting
- **Presigned URLs**: Secure direct-to-storage uploads
- **Multiple Storage Backends**: AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, etc.

## Upload Flow

### 1. Client-Side Flow

1. User selects/drops files
2. Client validates files against route config
3. Request presigned URLs from server
4. Upload files directly to storage using presigned URLs
5. Report completion back to server
6. Server processes completion callback

### 2. Server-Side Flow

1. Define file router with validation rules
2. Middleware runs for authentication/authorization
3. Generate presigned URLs for valid files
4. Handle upload completion callbacks
5. Process files (resize, metadata extraction, etc.)

### 3. Error Handling

- Client-side validation before upload
- Server-side validation on presigned URL generation
- Comprehensive error types and formatting
- Retry mechanisms for failed uploads

## Comparison with Our Current Implementation

- Next.js-specific implementation with custom hooks

#### 2. Upload Pattern

**UploadThing:**

```typescript
// 1. Request presigned URLs
const presignedUrls = await requestPresignedUrls(files);
// 2. Upload directly to storage
await uploadToStorage(files, presignedUrls);
// 3. Report completion
await reportCompletion(uploadResults);
```

**Our Implementation:**

```typescript
// Hybrid approach based on file size
if (isLargeFile) {
  // 1. Upload to blob storage first
  const blobResult = await storageManager.upload(file, "vercel_blob");
  // 2. Call API with blob URLs
  const result = await fetch("/api/memories", { body: JSON.stringify({ assets: blobResult }) });
} else {
  // 1. Upload directly to API (FormData)
  const result = await fetch("/api/memories", { body: formData });
}
```

#### 3. Type Safety

**UploadThing:**

- Full end-to-end type safety
- Generated client helpers from server definitions
- Compile-time route validation

- Manual storage selection logic based on user preferences
- Custom file processing pipeline with image variants

#### 5. User Experience

**UploadThing:**

```typescript
// Simple, declarative API
<UploadButton endpoint="videoAndImage" onClientUploadComplete={handleComplete} />
<UploadDropzone endpoint="videoAndImage" />
```

**Our Implementation:**

```typescript
// More complex, imperative API
const { isLoading, fileInputRef, handleUploadClick, handleFileUpload } = useFileUpload({
  mode: "folder",
  isOnboarding: true,
  onSuccess: () => console.log("Done"),
  onError: (error) => console.error(error),
});
```

#### 6. Authentication & User Management

**UploadThing:**

- Middleware-based authentication

- Storage preference-based routing

#### 7. File Processing

**UploadThing:**

- Built-in image processing
- Automatic format optimization
- CDN integration

**Our Implementation:**

- Custom image processing with multiple variants
- Manual asset creation (original, display, thumb)
- Custom storage key management

### What We Can Learn

#### 1. Type-Safe Router Pattern

```typescript
// Consider implementing a similar pattern
const fileRouter = {
  documents: f({
    pdf: { maxFileSize: "10MB", maxFileCount: 5 },
    image: { maxFileSize: "5MB", maxFileCount: 10 },
  })
    .middleware(authMiddleware)
    .onUploadComplete(processUpload),
};
```

#### 2. Presigned URL Pattern

- Reduces server load by uploading directly to storage
- Better for large files
- More scalable architecture

#### 3. Component Architecture

```typescript
// Reusable upload components
<UploadProvider>
  <UploadDropzone />
  <UploadFileView />
  <UploadButton />
</UploadProvider>
```

#### 4. Error Handling System

- Structured error types
- Custom error formatting
- Better error propagation

#### 5. Progress Granularity

```typescript
// Configurable progress reporting
onUploadProgress: (progress) => {
  // Fine-grained vs coarse progress
  console.log(`${progress.progress}% complete`);
};
```

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Adopt UploadThing Directly

Since UploadThing is open source, we could consider:

1. **Self-hosting UploadThing**

   - Deploy our own UploadThing instance
   - Customize it for our ICP integration needs
   - Maintain full control over the infrastructure

2. **Using UploadThing SDKs**

   - Adopt their client/server packages
   - Keep our custom storage providers
   - Benefit from their type safety and components

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Use UploadThing for standard uploads
   - Keep our custom ICP integration
   - Gradually migrate features

### UploadThing SDK Integration Requirements

**Core Functionality: Blob Storage Uploads**

- UploadThing is primarily designed for **blob storage uploads** (files to cloud storage)
- Uses presigned URLs to upload directly to storage providers (AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, etc.)
- **Not a database solution** - it's a file upload service

**Open Source Components:**

- **Frontend SDKs**: React, Vue, Svelte, Solid components and hooks
- **Server SDKs**: API route handlers for Next.js, Express, Fastify, etc.
- **Core Logic**: File validation, presigned URL generation, progress tracking

**Managed Backend Service (CLOSED SOURCE):**

- **UploadThing's Backend**: Handles presigned URL generation, file processing, storage management
- **API Endpoint**: `https://api.uploadthing.com` (managed service)
- **Ingest URLs**: `https://{region}.{ingestHost}` (managed file processing)
- **Token Required**: `UPLOADTHING_TOKEN` connects your app to their managed backend
- **❌ NOT Open Source**: The actual file processing, storage management, and backend infrastructure is proprietary

**What You CAN Access (Open Source):**

- ✅ Client-side upload logic and components
- ✅ Server-side API route handlers
- ✅ File validation and type checking
- ✅ Progress tracking and error handling
- ✅ Integration code for Next.js, Express, etc.

**What You CANNOT Access (Closed Source):**

- ❌ File processing backend code
- ❌ Storage provider management
- ❌ CDN and global distribution logic
- ❌ Presigned URL generation algorithms
- ❌ File optimization and transformation code

**Comparison with Your Current System:**

- **Your System**: Uploads files → Creates database records → Stores metadata in your database
- **UploadThing**: Uploads files → Stores in blob storage → Optional database metadata
- **Key Difference**: UploadThing focuses on the **file storage** part, not the **database integration** part

**Minimal Setup (No Database Required):**

- Only requires `UPLOADTHING_TOKEN` environment variable
- No database tables needed for basic functionality
- Works independently of your existing database schema

**Optional Database Integration:**

- Can optionally store file metadata in your database
- Example schema (from Drizzle example):
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE files (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    key TEXT NOT NULL,
    url TEXT NOT NULL,
    createdAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    uploadedBy INTEGER NOT NULL
  );
  ```

**Dual Upload Flow Implementation:**

```typescript
// 1. Keep existing upload flow
const { handleFileUpload } = useFileUpload({ mode: "folder" });

// 2. Add UploadThing alongside
const { startUpload } = useUploadThing("imageUploader", {
  onClientUploadComplete: (res) => {
    // Handle UploadThing results
    console.log("UploadThing upload complete:", res);
  },
});

// 3. Route based on user preference or file type
const handleUpload = (files: File[]) => {
  if (userPrefersUploadThing) {
    startUpload(files);
  } else {
    handleFileUpload(files);
  }
};
```
