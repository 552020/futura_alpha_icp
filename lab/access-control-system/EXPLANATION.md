# What We're Building - Simple Explanation

## The Problem

Right now, if you want to check if someone can access a memory, you have to:
1. Check if they're the owner
2. Check if they're a controller  
3. Check if they're in a connection group
4. Check if the memory is public
5. Check if they have a magic link
6. ... and more

This code is scattered everywhere and hard to maintain.

## The Solution

**One place to rule them all!** 

Instead of checking permissions everywhere, we have:

### 1. **Resource Keys** - Identify Any Resource
```javascript
const memory1 = new ResKey('Memory', 'memory_123');
const gallery1 = new ResKey('Gallery', 'gallery_456');
```

### 2. **Access Index** - Store All Permissions
```javascript
const accessIndex = new AccessIndex();

// Alice has full access to memory1
accessIndex.addAccess(memory1, aliceAccess);

// memory2 is public for authenticated users
accessIndex.setPublicPolicy(memory2, publicPolicy);
```

### 3. **One Function** - Check Any Permission
```javascript
const permissions = effectivePermMask(memory1, userContext, accessIndex, capsule);
// Returns: VIEW | DOWNLOAD | SHARE | MANAGE | OWN (or just VIEW, or NONE)
```

## How It Works

1. **Ownership Fast-Path**: If you own the resource → you get everything
2. **Direct Grants**: Check if you're explicitly given access
3. **Group Access**: Check if you're in a group that has access
4. **Magic Links**: Check if you have a valid temporary link
5. **Public Policy**: Check if the resource is public

## The Benefits

- ✅ **One place** to check permissions
- ✅ **Consistent** across all resource types
- ✅ **Efficient** - ownership check is super fast
- ✅ **Flexible** - supports all access patterns
- ✅ **Maintainable** - change logic in one place

## Real Example

```javascript
// Instead of this scattered code:
if (memory.owner === user || memory.controllers.includes(user) || 
    memory.connections.includes(user) || memory.isPublic) {
    // allow access
}

// We have this:
const permissions = effectivePermMask(memoryKey, userContext, accessIndex, capsule);
if (hasPermission(permissions, Perm.VIEW)) {
    // allow access
}
```

## The Rust Version

The Rust version does the same thing but:
- Uses `StableBTreeMap` for ICP persistence
- Implements `Storable` traits for serialization
- Handles type conversions between ICP and domain types
- Has more complex error handling

But the **core logic is identical**!
