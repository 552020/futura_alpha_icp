# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The "Store Forever" feature enables users to permanently store their photo galleries on the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain, providing immutable, decentralized storage that ensures their memories are preserved forever. This feature builds upon the existing Web2 gallery system and storage_edges architecture to replicate gallery data to ICP's blockchain infrastructure.

**MVP Development Principles:**

- **MVP over Clean Code**: Since the existing code is working with tests in place, we will change only what is necessary to implement the feature
- **Minimal Changes**: Preserve existing patterns and structures where possible
- **Incremental Enhancement**: Build upon current error handling rather than replacing it entirely
- **Working Software First**: Prioritize functional implementation over architectural perfection

**Current Implementation Status:**

- âœ… "Store Forever" buttons are implemented in gallery detail and preview pages
- âœ… ForeverStorageProgressModal UI component is implemented with step-by-step progress
- âœ… storage_edges table and memory_presence/gallery_presence views are implemented
- âœ… ICP gallery service structure is implemented with placeholder functions
- âœ… Internet Identity account linking flow is implemented
- ðŸ”„ Backend ICP canister integration needs to be connected to real endpoints
- ðŸ”„ Storage edge updates need to be integrated with the storage flow
- ðŸ”„ Gallery presence views need to be used for storage status display

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to store my gallery permanently on the Internet Computer using the existing "Store Forever" button, so that my memories are preserved forever and cannot be lost due to server failures or service shutdowns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks "Store Forever" on a gallery detail or preview page THEN the existing ForeverStorageProgressModal SHALL open and initiate the ICP storage process
2. WHEN the storage process begins THEN the system SHALL check for linked Internet Identity and prompt for linking if needed
3. WHEN authentication is complete THEN the system SHALL convert the gallery data to ICP-compatible format using existing convertWeb2GalleryToICP function
4. WHEN data conversion is complete THEN the system SHALL call the real backend canister store_gallery_forever endpoint (not placeholder)
5. WHEN storage is successful THEN after ICP commit and hash verification, the system SHALL upsert storage_edges(..., backend='icp-canister') with present=true, sync_state='idle', last_synced_at; gallery status is derived from views
6. WHEN storage fails THEN the existing error handling in ForeverStorageProgressModal SHALL provide clear error messages and allow retry

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see clear progress during the storage process using the existing progress modal, so that I understand what's happening and feel confident the process is working.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the storage process starts THEN the existing ForeverStorageProgressModal SHALL display with step-by-step indicators (auth, prepare, store, verify, success)
2. WHEN each step begins THEN the existing progress indicator SHALL update to show current step with appropriate icons and messages
3. WHEN a step is in progress THEN the existing modal SHALL show loading animations and progress messages with real progress data
4. WHEN a step completes THEN the existing modal SHALL show success indicators and move to next step
5. WHEN all steps complete THEN the existing success state SHALL show celebration message with storage confirmation
6. WHEN an error occurs THEN the existing error handling SHALL show specific error messages with retry functionality

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my ICP identity to be managed automatically, so that I can use the "Store Forever" feature without complex blockchain setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN "Store Forever" starts AND no internet-identity account is linked THEN the system SHALL link II via account row (provider='internet-identity', type='oidc') if missing; never replace the current session
2. WHEN a user has an existing linked II account THEN the system SHALL use that account for ICP operations
3. WHEN II authentication completes THEN the system SHALL create an account row (provider='internet-identity', type='oidc') linked to the same user
4. WHEN the linked principal is ready THEN the system SHALL use it for all ICP operations
5. WHEN II authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options

2. WHEN converting memory references THEN the system SHALL create GalleryMemoryEntry objects with position and captions
3. WHEN validating memory references THEN the system SHALL validate every gallery item resolves to an existing memory (id + type) and abort with a list of missing/invalid references; Web2 provides memory list to ICP for presence operations
4. WHEN conversion is complete THEN the system SHALL verify data integrity before storage
5. IF memory references are invalid THEN the system SHALL report specific validation errors with the list of missing memories

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and manage my ICP-stored galleries with visual indicators, so that I can access my permanently stored memories and understand their storage status.

2. WHEN gallery_presence.icp_complete = true THEN the system SHALL show "Stored Forever" badges on gallery cards and headers
3. WHEN viewing gallery details THEN the system SHALL read from ICP iff icp_complete=true; if partial, prefer Web2, but allow per-memory 'view on ICP' where asset_icp=true
4. WHEN galleries are partially on ICP THEN the system SHALL show "Partially on ICP" badges with unified view
5. WHEN ICP storage fails to load THEN the system SHALL fallback to Web2 data with appropriate warnings using existing error handling

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive error handling and rollback capabilities, so that failed storage attempts don't leave the system in inconsistent states.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and retry options
2. WHEN data conversion fails THEN the system SHALL set sync_state='failed' with sync_error and report errors
3. WHEN ICP storage fails THEN the system SHALL set sync_state='failed' and retain diagnostic sync_error; UI shows retry

2. WHEN adding ICP storage THEN the system SHALL not break existing Web2 gallery functionality
3. WHEN displaying galleries THEN the system SHALL show unified lists regardless of storage location
4. WHEN performing gallery operations THEN the system SHALL read from ICP iff icp_complete=true; if partial, prefer Web2, but allow per-memory 'view on ICP' where asset_icp=true; writes continue to Web2; ICP is a replication target
5. WHEN migrating data THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity between memories and galleries

### Requirement 10

5. WHEN the linking process fails THEN the user SHALL remain authenticated; show retry without leaving the flow

### Requirement 15

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to connect the existing UI components to real backend functionality, so that the "Store Forever" feature works end-to-end with actual ICP storage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storeGalleryForever is called THEN the system SHALL replace the placeholder storeGalleryOnICP function with real backend canister calls
2. WHEN gallery storage succeeds THEN the system SHALL update storage_edges table with present=true, sync_state='idle', and appropriate metadata
