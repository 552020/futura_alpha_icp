# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements capsule migration functionality that allows users to create their own personal canister containing all their capsule data. Users will be able to migrate from the shared backend canister to their own dedicated canister instance, taking all their memories, connections, and capsule information with them. This provides users with full ownership and control over their data while maintaining the same capsule functionality in their personal canister.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a capsule owner, I want to migrate my capsule data to a new personal canister, so that I can have full ownership and control over my memories and connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user calls migrate_capsule THEN the system SHALL create a new canister with the user as the sole controller
2. WHEN migration starts THEN the system SHALL export all user's capsule data including memories, connections, and metadata
3. WHEN data is exported THEN the system SHALL include all memory blobs, connection information, and capsule configuration
4. WHEN new canister is created THEN the system SHALL install a compatible WASM module that provides the same data structures and API endpoints
5. WHEN migration completes THEN the system SHALL return the new canister ID and migration status
6. WHEN migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and leave original data intact
7. WHEN user has no capsule data THEN the system SHALL reject migration with appropriate error message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a capsule owner, I want to export my memories and data for backup purposes, so that I have control over my data and can access it even if the frontend breaks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user calls export_capsule_data THEN the system SHALL provide all their memories, connections, and metadata in a downloadable format
2. WHEN export is requested THEN the system SHALL include memory blobs, connection information, and capsule configuration
3. WHEN export completes THEN the user SHALL receive a structured data package (JSON/ZIP format)
4. WHEN user downloads export THEN they SHALL have a complete backup of their capsule data
5. WHEN frontend is unavailable THEN users SHALL be able to access their exported data independently
6. WHEN export fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages about what data couldn't be exported
7. WHEN user has no data THEN export SHALL return an empty but valid data structure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to control capsule migration with a pay-forward model, so that users can fund their personal canisters for a chosen duration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user initiates migration THEN they SHALL pay for their chosen runtime duration through the payment system
2. WHEN user selects duration THEN the system SHALL convert the payment to cycles and fund the new personal canister
3. WHEN migration is for testing/MVP THEN small capsules SHALL be created for free or minimal cost
4. WHEN user has insufficient payment THEN the system SHALL reject migration with clear cost requirements
5. WHEN admin sets migration costs THEN different duration tiers SHALL be available (1 month, 6 months, 1 year, etc.)
6. WHEN migration succeeds THEN the converted cycles SHALL be transferred to the new personal canister
7. WHEN cycles run low in personal canister THEN user SHALL be notified to extend their subscription

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a capsule owner, I want to access migration functionality through the NextJS frontend, so that I can easily manage my data storage options.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user accesses ICP page in NextJS frontend THEN they SHALL see migration options
2. WHEN user chooses storage options THEN they SHALL be able to select Web2 storage, shared canister, and/or personal canister
3. WHEN user selects personal canister THEN the frontend SHALL guide them through the migration process
4. WHEN migration is initiated THEN the frontend SHALL show progress and status updates
5. WHEN user wants to copy files THEN they SHALL have options to download their memories as files
6. WHEN user has multiple storage options THEN they SHALL be able to manage data across all locations
7. WHEN migration completes THEN the frontend SHALL provide access to the new personal canister

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a capsule owner, I want my personal canister to provide the same core functionality as the shared backend, so that I can access my memories and connections seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN personal canister is created THEN it SHALL provide the same API endpoints for memory and connection management
2. WHEN user accesses personal canister THEN all their memories SHALL be available and functional
3. WHEN user queries data THEN the personal canister SHALL respond with the same data structures as the shared backend
4. WHEN user adds new memories THEN the personal canister SHALL store them with the same functionality
5. WHEN user manages connections THEN the personal canister SHALL handle relationships identically
6. WHEN frontend connects to personal canister THEN it SHALL work without modification
7. WHEN personal canister functionality differs THEN it SHALL only be in non-essential features

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a capsule owner, I want flexible data storage options managed through the NextJS frontend, so that I can choose between Web2 storage, shared canister, and personal canister based on my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user manages memories in NextJS frontend THEN they SHALL be able to configure Web2 (traditional storage)
2. WHEN user chooses shared canister THEN the frontend SHALL keep their data in the managed backend canister
3. WHEN user chooses personal canister THEN the frontend SHALL initiate migration to their own canister
4. WHEN user has multiple storage options THEN the NextJS frontend SHALL manage combinations of all three
5. WHEN user switches storage methods THEN the frontend SHALL provide migration tools between options
6. WHEN user accesses memories THEN the NextJS frontend SHALL seamlessly retrieve from the appropriate storage location
7. WHEN storage options are configured THEN the frontend SHALL preserve user preferences across sessions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want basic migration controls for the MVP phase, so that I can manage resources without over-engineering the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration is requested THEN the system SHALL check basic resource availability
2. WHEN backend has sufficient cycles THEN migration SHALL be allowed to proceed
3. WHEN user provides adequate cycles THEN their personal canister SHALL be created
4. WHEN migration fails due to resources THEN clear error messages SHALL be provided
5. WHEN admin needs to disable migrations THEN a simple toggle SHALL be available
6. WHEN system tracks basic usage THEN it SHALL record successful and failed migration attempts
7. WHEN MVP phase requires simplicity THEN complex monitoring and quotas SHALL be deferred to future versions

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want the team to focus on delivering an MVP rather than a full-fledged application, so that we can validate the concept quickly and iterate based on user feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing migration features THEN the team SHALL prioritize core functionality over advanced features
2. WHEN designing the system THEN complex monitoring, analytics, and optimization SHALL be deferred to future versions
3. WHEN building the MVP THEN the focus SHALL be on basic migration, export, and personal canister creation
4. WHEN users test the MVP THEN they SHALL be able to migrate their data and access it in a personal canister
5. WHEN MVP is complete THEN it SHALL demonstrate the core value proposition without unnecessary complexity
6. WHEN future iterations are planned THEN they SHALL build upon the solid MVP foundation
7. WHEN technical decisions are made THEN they SHALL favor simplicity and speed of delivery over perfection

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the migration functionality to integrate seamlessly with existing backend features, so that I can use both capsule management and migration from a single interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migration functions are added THEN existing backend functionality SHALL remain unaffected
2. WHEN backend upgrades occur THEN migration state SHALL be preserved alongside capsule data
3. WHEN admin management is used THEN it SHALL work consistently across both capsule and migration features
4. WHEN the backend initializes THEN migration configuration SHALL be set up with sensible defaults
5. WHEN Candid interface is exported THEN it SHALL include both existing and new migration methods
6. WHEN memory management occurs THEN both capsule and migration data SHALL be handled appropriately
7. WHEN authentication is required THEN the same principal-based system SHALL be used for migration operations
